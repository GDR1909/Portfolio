    "aboutMeText": "Hello! My name is Davide Religioso and I'm from Stuttgart in Germany. I have always been enthusiastic about the Internet, digitalization and technical innovations. Now it's time to bring this enthusiasm to my job as a frontend developer.\n\nJust over a year ago, I decided to further my education in the field of frontend development. The Developer Academy was a great support and helped me to achieve my goals. Without their help, it would have been much more difficult.\n\nIn my job as a CNC milling cutter, I have learned to work precisely and pay attention to detail. I would now like to use these skills in programming to develop myself further.",
