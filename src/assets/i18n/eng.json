    "aboutMeText": "Hello! My name is Davide Religioso, and I'm a frontend developer from Stuttgart, Germany. I've always been fascinated by technological innovations. Now, I'm eager to incorporate this passion into my professional life.\n\nOver a year ago, I decided to pursue further education in frontend development. The Developer Academy supported me throughout this journey and provided invaluable assistance in realizing my goals.\n\nBefore transitioning into frontend development, I worked as a CNC miller. In this role, precision and adherence to specifications were paramount. This experience honed my skills in meticulous work and attention to detail. Now, I aim to leverage these transferable skills in programming, making me well-suited to take on a position in the field.",
