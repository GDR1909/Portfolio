            Hello! My name is Davide Religioso, and I'm a frontend developer from Stuttgart, Germany. I've always been
            fascinated by technological innovations. Now, I'm eager to incorporate this passion into my professional
            life. <br>
            <br>
            Over a year ago, I made the decision to pursue further education in frontend development. The Developer
            Academy supported me throughout this journey and provided invaluable assistance in realizing my goals. <br>
            <br>
            Prior to transitioning into frontend development, I worked as a CNC miller. In this role, precision and
            adherence to specifications were paramount. This experience honed my skills in meticulous work and attention
            to detail. Now, I aim to leverage these transferable skills in programming, making me well-suited to take on
            a position in the field.
